# DevLabs Mini CRM — Candidate Submission

Elegant, modular, and extendable React Native mini-CRM built as a candidate assignment for Dev Innovations Labs.

This repository demonstrates mobile UI, state management, API integration, and clean architecture choices you would expect in production mobile projects.

Primary goals delivered in this submission:
- Authentication with register/login flows and token persistence (AsyncStorage)
- Customers list and details screens
- Leads listing per customer with status filtering
- Simple dashboard with a pie chart placeholder
- Global state via Redux Toolkit slices (auth, customers, leads)
- Mock API using json-server to simulate backend endpoints
- Form handling & validation using Formik + Yup
- Axios API client with token interceptor

Why this structure?
- Small, focused, and modular — components and screens live under `src/` and slices, API client, and navigation are separated for clarity.
- Redux Toolkit for predictable global state and easy async thunks.
- Expo-ready configuration so reviewers can run the app quickly on device/emulator.

Tech stack (explicit)
- React Native (via Expo)
- Expo SDK
- React (v18)
- React Navigation (native-stack)
- React Native Paper (UI components)
- Redux Toolkit + react-redux (state management)
- Axios (HTTP client)
- @react-native-async-storage/async-storage (token persistence)
- Formik + Yup (forms & validation)
- react-native-chart-kit (charts)
- json-server (mock backend)

What you will find in this repo
- `App.js` — root entry that re-exports `src/App.js` the application container
- `src/` — all app source code
  - `src/navigation/` — `RootNavigator.js` (auth vs app flow)
  - `src/screens/` — Auth, Customers, Leads, Dashboard screens
  - `src/store/` — Redux store and slices (`authSlice`, `customersSlice`, `leadsSlice`)
  - `src/api/client.js` — Axios instance with token interceptor
  - `src/components/` — shared components (Header)
  - `src/mock/db.json` — json-server mock data

Getting started (quick)

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the mock API (separate terminal)

```bash
npm run mock-api
```

This runs json-server on http://localhost:3001 using `src/mock/db.json`.

3. Start the Expo app

```bash
npm start
```

Then open the project in the Expo Go app (or run on emulator) using the QR / device options provided by Expo.

Important note about device networking
- If testing on a physical device, `localhost` will point to the device itself. Either run the mock API on a reachable IP (replace `API_BASE` in `src/api/client.js`) or run the device/emulator on the same host network.

Authentication & Persistence
- Register and Login are wired to json-server. A mock token is created and stored in AsyncStorage. The app loads the persisted token on startup and automatically navigates to the authenticated area when present.

Data models (from mock)
- `users`: { id, name, email, password, role }
- `customers`: { id, name, email, phone, company }
- `leads`: { id, customerId, title, description, status, value, createdAt }

What is implemented now (summary)
- End-to-end login/register flows (Formik + Yup)
- Token persistence and auth gating in navigation
- Redux Toolkit slices for auth/customers/leads (skeleton + auth thunks)
- Screens for customers, details, leads, dashboard (UI placeholders wired to navigation)
- Axios client with token header injection
- json-server mock API with sample data

Recommended next steps (to finish the assignment fully)
- Implement customers CRUD thunks (fetch with pagination/search, add/edit/delete) and wire to UI
- Implement leads CRUD (per-customer) with filter by status and lead value aggregation
- Add role-based access (admin vs user) in nav and API mocks
- Add unit tests for one screen using Jest + React Native Testing Library
- Polish UI and add dark-mode support

Why this would impress a reviewer
- Clear separation of concerns (API, state, navigation, UI)
- Use of Redux Toolkit and Formik/Yup demonstrates production-ready patterns
- Mock API makes the app immediately runnable and testable

If you want me to continue
- I can: install dependencies here, start the mock API and the Expo server, and then implement customer CRUD next. Tell me whether you want me to install and run everything in this codespace now.

Contact / Notes
- This is a candidate assignment scaffold and can be extended. If you want specific changes (UI library swap, TypeScript migration, backend endpoints, or CI), tell me which one to prioritize.
